        <item>The bottom navbar is your primary mode of navigation; swipe up or long press on it for more options and use the back button to go back at anytime.</item>
        <item>The icon on the left of the top toolbar also contains your current team in focus. You can switch the current team at anytime by tapping on it, or in context menus on various screens.</item>
        <item>When adding team roles, be careful who you make an admin! An admin cannot be downgraded, and can delete any team they\'re on.</item>
